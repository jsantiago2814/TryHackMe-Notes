## Pre Security Notes

* To find hidden URLs, we will use a tool called dirb. This tool uses a brute-force approach, by taking a list of potential page names and testing one by one if they exist in your website. This approach works because people use predictable names a lot of times.

* Command -> dirb [URL]

* Offensive secuuirty = red team

* Offensive security involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholds in applications to gain unauthorized access. The goal is ot understand hacker tactics and enhance our secuirty defenses. 

* Defensive security = blue team

* Blue Team's two main tasks are preventing intrusions from occuring and detecting intrusions when they do occur and responding properly.

* Some tasks for blue team include cyber security awareness, documenting & managing assets, preventative security, logging & monitoryng, and Frameworks, Policies, & Procedures.

* SOC -> Security Operations Center: isa  team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some main interests are: Trends & Vulnerability Awareness, Policy Violations, Unauthorized & Illegal Activity, and Intrusion & Breach Detection.

* Digital Forensiics is the application of traditional foresic science processes to digital devices. Digital forensics is used to preserve and analyse digital evidence to aide in the investigation of incidents, such as a breach. This may involve looking at information from: File System, System Memory, System Logs, and Network Logs

* Incident response is how organizations manage security events such as breaches, data leaks and cyber attacks. An incident response process is a defined set of stages to minimize damage, contain the threat and recover fast. The proces looks like this: Preparation -> Detection & Analysis -> Containment, Eradication, and Recovery -> Post-Incident Activity

* Preparation: Creating the necessary resources and frameworks to handle an incident.

* Detection & Analysis: Using tooling and processes to detect incidents and assess their scope (reach) and severity. Logs can be analyzed for suspicious events.

* Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Limiting the impact of the incident, such as preventing a virus from spreading and eliminae the cause and restore affected systems.

* Post-Incident Activity: Review the incident overall, how it was handled and could've been prevented. What were the learning points throughout the process?

* SIEM = Security Information and Event Management tool, gathers security-related information and events from various sources and presents them in one dashboard.
